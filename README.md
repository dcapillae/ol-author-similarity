Just want a quick way to find duplicate works by an author on Open Library.

Uses [string-similarity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-similarity) to find works with > .9 similarity;

Created by [Raymond Berger](https://github.com/RayBB). Forked from [original source code](https://github.com/RayBB/onepagers/tree/main/sites/ol-author-similarity).
